JP Morgan Chase
JP Morgan Chase is the largest bank in the U.S., and the sixth largest bank in the world.

It has more than 15,000 ATMs and over 5,000 branches across the country; and all its accounts have free online banking, mobile banking and a visa debit card as standard.

It also offers a tailored student account and business banking services. The student account is free for up to five years. However, in order to qualify, you have to be between 17 and 24 years old and prove you’re a student.

The business accounts start at $10 a month, but the fee can be waived if you keep at least $1,500 in your account. You’ll also get a business debit card and up to 500 fee-free transactions a month.

Bank Of America
Bank of America’s basic bank account costs $12 a month, but it’s free if you pay in at least $250 each month. Whether you’re planning to work or study in the U.S., it’s likely you can easily meet this minimum amount.

You’ll also get a visa debit card, which comes with liability protection as standard. This ensures you’re refunded if your card is lost or stolen and used to make purchases without your permission.

Bank of America doesn’t have bank accounts specifically for students. However, the monthly fee will be waived if you’re a student under 23.

There are also two business bank accounts to choose from, depending on the size of your business. These accounts include a free business savings account and tailored online banking that integrates with accounting software.

Citibank
Citibank’s basic bank account is unique because you don’t need to make a minimum deposit in order to open it.

You’ll also get some extra features, including protection against unplanned overdrafts and special access to thousands of concerts, movie screenings and other events.

Citibank no longer has a dedicated student account. However, it does have a range of business accounts. These accounts have unplanned overdraft protection, a number of free transactions each month and better rates on loans and other lines of credit.

Wells Fargo
Wells Fargo’s bank accounts start at $10 a month, reduced to $5 a month if you’re a student aged 17 to 24. You’ll get a visa debit card, free online bill payments and free online and mobile banking.

There is also a range of business bank accounts to choose from. These will give you a set number of free transactions a month, business debit and credit cards, and merchant services.

Other banks to consider
While JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Wells Fargo are the four biggest banks in the US, some other banks are also worth checking out.

The Bank of Internet USA is an entirely internet-based bank, which means it doesn't have any physical branches. It’s unusual because, unlike many other banks, it offers up to 0.71% interest on your account balance. In addition, it has no monthly fees, no ATM fees and no overdraft fees. You can apply for an account online. However, you’ll need a social security number, a valid U.S. address and a US driving licence or state ID.

Capital One is another great option to consider. They have over 40,000 free ATMs across the U.S. and no monthly fees or minimum deposit amounts. More to the point, you can earn up to 0.9% interest a year. If you’re a U.S. resident, you can apply for an account here. Of course, it’s always a good idea to look at what different banks have to offer before you commit to a bank account. You can compare bank accounts online here and here.
